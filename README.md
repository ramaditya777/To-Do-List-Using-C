Below is a simple README file for your To-Do List Application project:
  To-Do List Application in C
   Overview
This is a simple console-based To-Do List Application written in the C programming language. The application allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, display the list of tasks, and save tasks to a file. It also supports loading tasks from a file when the program starts.
   Features
1.   Add Task:  
   - Users can add a new task to the to-do list by entering a task description.
2.   Display Tasks:  
   - The application can display the current list of tasks, showing each task's description and completion status.
3.   Mark Task as Completed:  
   - Users can mark a task as completed by entering the task number.
4.   Save and Exit:  
   - The program allows users to save the current list of tasks to a file named "tasks.txt" before exiting.
5.   Load from File:  
   - When the program starts, it attempts to load tasks from the "tasks.txt" file, providing persistence between program runs.
   How to Use
1.   Compile:  
   - Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
     ```bash
     gcc todo.c -o todo
     ```
2.   Run:  
   - Run the compiled executable.
     ```bash
     ./todo
     ```
3.   Menu:  
   - Follow the on-screen menu to perform different operations (add task, display tasks, mark task as completed, save and exit).
4.   Persistence:  
   - The program automatically loads tasks from "tasks.txt" when started and saves tasks to the same file when the user chooses to exit.
   Limitations
- The application supports a maximum of 100 tasks.
- Task descriptions are limited to 100 characters.
